Description             : Replaces the chainsaw with a cool bloody samurai
                          sword. Remember the scene in Pulp Fiction where
                          Bruce Willis and his friend are being held
                          prisoner in the pawn shop? Bruce passes up a
                          shotgun, a chainsaw, then picks up a sword and
                          proceeds to slash up the hillbillies who are taking
                          turns anal-raping the black guy? Anyway, with this
                          patch you can slash up some undead. Enjoy!
                          Oh, and this sword does a lot more damage than the
                          chainsaw used to.
