Special thanks to RTB and Apoc!

Notes: The Model of the Spartan had to be edited to fit the HL2 Skeleton. Because it is, it may look a bit "different" but the model itself does not break, bend weirdly or deform. I recommend waiting for the SFM release to pose and record with, as when that comes out it will not be edited, the proportions will be as they are in Halo 3, and will release with a Ragdoll version for GMod.
