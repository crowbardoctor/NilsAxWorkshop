This is a fixed and improved version of JASON's great addon, Zombie/NPC Invasion.

The original addon IS NOT required! Please uninstall it to prevent any conflicts.

# Summary
This addon will constantly spawn random NPCs within a certain distance of any player. 
As of now no other addons/gamemodes do this without manually placing NPC spawners everywhere. 

Not only zombies can be spawned, but any class that works normally in the game.
Spawn settings can be changed via the "Spawn Editor" in the Q menu options. 

This mod REQUIRES NPC info_nodes to work properly on all maps. Without them NPCs might not spawn. You can use the Nodegraph Editor to add your own info_nodes 

Please rate this addon! Thanks 

Features
Multiple spawn profiles
Advanced spawn options (KeyValues and spawn flags)
Dynamic support for all NPCs
Explosive NPCs
Chase players setting


Settings
You can change all of the settings via the spawn menu interface (in the Q menu) or through the GMod console.

In the GMod console you can use the following commands: 
zinv 1/0 - On/Off. 
zinv_explode 1/0 - NPCs explode when they die. (added so they can damage props if GCombat is installed) 
zinv_maxdist 0-9999 - NPCs wont spawn further than this. 
zinv_mindist 0-9999 - NPCs will only spawn after this distance from a player. 
zinv_chaseplayers 1/0 - NPCs will try to move to the closest player. 
zinv_maxspawn 0-300 - Max NPCs

To enable the console, go options>keyboard>advanced>enable developer console, then press the "~" key (the button above the tab key).
