# fun_tools

Fun_tools adds a chainsaw, jackhammer and flare gun. The chainsaw cuts down whole trees (usually) and makes a slow, but powerful weapon. The jackhammer digs large volumes of rock and minerals. The flare gun shoots a number of bright, but short-lived flares into a volume, lighting it up briefly.

I've also included an easy to make bed and a decorative body pillow.
